# Stargazer

Welcome to Stargazer, the most advanced theme ever created for WordPress without compromising standards. This is the only theme in the world that you'll find that extends WordPress' built-in theme features so robustly but naturally. The theme is built on the rock-solid Hybrid Core theme framework. 

It's built with search-engine optimization (SEO) in mind by utilizing the most current HTML5 conventions and [Schema.org](http://schema.org) microdata. It also integrates with useful theme add-on plugins like [Custom Background Extended](http://wordpress.org/plugins/custom-background-extended), [Custom Header Extended](http://wordpress.org/plugins/custom-header-extended), [Whistles](http://wordpress.org/plugins/whistles), and more.
